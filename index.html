        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a frontend software developer and techie currently based in
          Calgary, Alberta. I have strong skills in HTML, Javascript and CSS and
          I am very experienced in Angular. Additionally, I have strong skills
          and relevant experience in backend languages such as Python, Golang
          and C# as well as a deep understanding of data structures and
          algorithms. In my spare time you might find me on skis or a bicycle
          somewhere in the mountains, lifting heavy things in the gym or playing
          with my dog.
